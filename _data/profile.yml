  Hi, my name is Le Thien Phuc Nguyen. </p> <p> I am from Vietnam, and I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by Professor <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yongjaelee/"> Yong Jae Lee </a>.
  Fortunately, I have a chance to work with my mentor <a href="https://www.zhuoranyu.com/">Zhuoran Yu</a>, a PhD student from Professor Lee's lab.
  </p>
  <p>
  My research interests focus on multimodal models, with a particular emphasis on video, audio, image, and large language models (LLMs).
