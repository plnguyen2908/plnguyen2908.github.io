<div class="p-4">
    <h2>Welcome to my Showcase!</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        <code>Showcase</code> is a page where I show off almost everything about my hobbies and life. It can be the photo of my (previous) pets, my favorite papers, or my favorite projects.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
        You can create a new showcase item by creating a new file in the <code>_showcase</code> folder. It gives you the highest flexibility to customize the item using any HTML code.
    </p> -->
    <!-- <p>
        Cards are ordered by the <code>date</code> field in the front matter in descending order. The <code>width</code> field is used to determine the width of the card, ranging from 1 to 12.
        Layout is done by the <a href="https://masonry.desandro.com/" target="_blank">Masonry</a> library.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a tidy layout, it is recommended to set the width of the cards to be either multiple of 3 or multiple of 4 for all cards, except for small badges that do not take up much space (width=1).
    </p> -->
