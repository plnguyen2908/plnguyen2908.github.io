    <p>
        I used to own three different cats when I was in highschool. Coincidentally, all three of them are male, and their names are <code>lúa</code>, <code>gạo</code>, <code>thóc</code>, respectively. All three of the names are written in Vietnamese which stand for three growth stages of a rice plant.
